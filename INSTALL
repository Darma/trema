Pre-requirements
================

Before installing Trema, please make sure that your development
environment satisfies with the following requirements.

- Operating system

Trema has only tested with the following operating systems:

  Ubuntu 10.10 (Intel x86, Desktop Edition)
  Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 (squeeze) (i386)

Trema may also run on other GNU/Linux distributions but not tested and
NOT SUPPORTED at this moment.

- Third-party software

Trema relies on the following third-party software.

  GCC
  GNU Make
  Ruby
  RubyGems
  Sudo
  libpcap

If you are using Ubuntu 10.10 Desktop Edition or Debian GNU/Linux 6.0
(squeeze) you can simply install them as follows. Other packages than
listed below should have been installed by default operating system
installation or will be installed automatically due to install
dependencies.

  $ sudo apt-get install gcc make ruby ruby-dev rubygems sudo libpcap-dev


How to build and install
========================

  $ tar xzvf trema.tar.gz
  $ cd trema
  $ ./build.rb


How to run a sample application
===============================

The following command allows you to run a sample application named
"routing switch" that emulates a virtual layer 2 switch formed by
multiple OpenFlow switches.

  $ ./trema run -c ./src/examples/routing_switch/routing_switch_null.conf

The command "trema" loads the specified configuration file
(routing_switch_null.conf) and then runs required functional modules
(processes) automatically.

For detailed explanation on the command, please refer to QUICKSTART.


(Optional) Automated build and test script
==========================================

The file "cruise.rb" in the top-level source tree is an automated
build and test script. It builds Trema, then runs unit tests and
system-level tests of sample applications with emulated OpenFlow
networks.

Before running the script, the following software packages are required.

  Cucumber
  RSpec
  rcov

If you are using Ubuntu 10.10 or Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 (squeeze), you
can install them as follows:

  $ sudo gem install cucumber rspec rcov --remote

To execute the script, simply type as follows:

  $ ./cruise.rb
